\section*{Introduction}

These are my notes for the seminars that happen in the \href{https://www.cs.toronto.edu/theory/}{Theory Group} at The University of Toronto. Many thanks to \href{http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bor/}{Professor Allan Borodin} for allowing me to attend the Theory Group seminars and helping out.\\

A PDF of these notes is available at \url{https://rishit-dagli.github.io/cs-theory-notes/main.pdf}. An online version of these notes are available at \url{https://rishit-dagli.github.io/cs-theory-notes}.\\

The Theory Group focuses on theory of computation. The group is interested in using mathematical techniques to understand the nature of computation and to design and analyze algorithms for important and fundamental problems.\\

The members of the theory group are all interested, in one way or another, in the limitations of computation: What problems are not feasible to solve on a computer? How can the infeasibility of a problem be used to rigorously construct secure cryptographic protocols? What problems cannot be solved faster using more machines? What are the limits to how fast a particular problem can be solved or how much space is needed to solve it? How do randomness, parallelism, the operations that are allowed, and the need for fault tolerance or security affect this?

\section{Lower Bounds for Locally Decodable Codes from Semirandom CSP Refutation}

7th October 2022\\

\noindent The related paper: Combinatorial lower bounds for 3-query LDCs by \citet{Alrabiah2022-ds}. Seminar by \href{https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pmanohar/}{Peter Manohar}. \cite{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1911.10698} \cite{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2109.04415}

\subsection{Abstract}

A code $C$ is a q-locally decodable code (q-LDC) if one can recover any chosen bit $b_i$ of the $k$-bit message b with good confidence by randomly querying the $n$-bit encoding x on at most $q$ coordinates. Existing constructions of $2$-LDCs achieve blocklength $n = exp(O(k))$, and lower bounds show that this is in fact tight. However, when $q = 3$, far less is known: the best constructions have $n = subexp(k)$, while the best known lower bounds, that have stood for nearly two decades, only show a quadratic lower bound of $n \geq \Omega(k^2)$ on the blocklength.\\

\noindent In this talk, we will survey a new approach to prove lower bounds for LDCs using recent advances in refuting semirandom instances of constraint satisfaction problems. These new tools yield, in the $3$-query case, a near-cubic lower bound of $n \geq \tilde{\Omega}(k^3)$, improving on prior work by a polynomial factor in $k$.

\subsection{Locally Decodable Codes}

Take codes $b \in {0,1}^k \rightarrow x \in {0,1}^n$

\noindent Codes $x$ are read by the decoder, $i \in [k]$, $\hat{b_i} \in {0,1}$

\begin{definition}
$C$ is a $(q, \delta, \epsilon)$-locally decodable if for any $x$ with $\bigtriangleup(x, Enc(b)) \leq \delta n$, $Dec^x(i) = b_i$ w.p. $\geq \frac{1}{2} + \epsilon$ for any $i$.
\end{definition}

\noindent Ask the question, what is the best possible rate for a $q$-LDC given a $q$?

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } 
 \hline
 $q$ & Lower Bound & Upper Bound \\
 \hline
 2 & $2^{\Omega(k)} \leq n$ & $n \leq 2^k$ \\ 
 3 & $k^2 \leq n$ & $n \leq exp(k^{o(1)})$ \\
 $O(1)$, even & $k^{\frac{q}{q+1}} \leq n$ & $n \leq exp(k^{o(1)})$ \\ 
 $O(1)$, odd & $k^{\frac{q+1}{q-1}} \leq n$ & $n \leq exp(k^{o(1)})$ \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent Focus on the case $q=3$, we have gotten better bounds:

\begin{equation}
k \leq n \leq 2^k
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
k^2 \leq n \leq exp(exp(\sqrt{\log k \log \log k}))
\end{equation*}

\noindent In \cite{Alrabiah2022-ds}, they show that a better minimum bound can be found than these existing ones for $q=3$:

\begin{equation}
k^3 \leq n
\end{equation}

\noindent The main result is that:

\begin{theorem}
Let $C$ be a $(3, \delta, \epsilon)$-locally decodable codes. Then $n \geq \tilde{\Omega}_{\delta, \epsilon}(k^3)$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent Semi-random CSP refutation comes to our aid to prove this! The intuitive way to put this theorem is that $q$-LDC lower bound is same as refuting "LDC" $q$-XOR.

\subsection{How to prove the Theorem}

The idea:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $q$-LDC lower bound is same as refuting "LDC" $q$-XOR \phantomsection\label{proofp1}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item CSP Refutation
        \end{itemize}
    \item Proof of existing $q$-LDC lower bound for $q$ even
    \item Proof sketch of $k^3$ lower bound
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Normally Decodable Codes}

We can see that the decoder we have can arbitrary but WLOG we can assume there are $q$-unif hypergraphs ${H_1, H_2, \cdots H_k}$ where every $H_i$ is such that:

\begin{equation*}
H_i \subseteq {[n] \choose q}
\end{equation*}

\noindent We can also see that:

\noindent Each $H_i$ is a matching such that $|H_i| \geq \delta n$

\noindent and, $Dec(i)$ picks $C \leftarrow H_i$ and outputs $\sum_{j \in C} x_j$\\

\noindent One such example is the Hadmard code:

\begin{equation}
b \in {0,1}^k \mapsto f = (\langle b, v \rangle)_{v \in {0,1}}^k
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
b_i = f(e_i) = f(v) + f(v+e_i)
\end{equation*}

\noindent Can think of this as $v$ and $v+e_i$ are connected.\\

\noindent Matching vector codes are $\approx \mathbb{Z} _{m}^{h}$

\subsection{Proof: Going from LDC to XOR}

We suppose that our code is linear and that there exists $q$-unif hypergraphs ${H_1, H_2, \cdots H_k}$.\\

\noindent We also know that:

Each $H_i$ is a matching such that $|H_i| \geq \delta n$

and, $Dec(i)$ picks $C \leftarrow H_i$ and outputs $\sum_{j \in C} x_j$\\

\noindent So, we start by considering a $q$-XOR instance $\psi_b$:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    \textit{Vars: } & \{x_j\}_{j \in [n]}\\
    \textit{Over Equations: } & \sum_{j \in C} x_j = b_i, \forall i \in [k], C \in H_i
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\noindent We can write down the maximum fraction of satisfiable constraints: $val(\psi_b) = 1$ for any $b \in {0,1}^k$.\\

\noindent It is sufficient now if we can argue that $\psi_b$ is unsat with high probability for some random $b$ when $n \ll k^{\frac{q}{q-2}}$.\\

\noindent Now we need to refute XOR, there are many ways to argue unsatisfiability of an XOR instance. One reason why we can not use probablistic approaches here is that $\psi_b$ only has $k$ bits of randomness.\\

\noindent One way we can have some success here is to use a refutation algorithm

\begin{equation*}
\psi \rightarrow A \rightarrow algval(\psi)
\end{equation*}

\noindent With this the guarantee then would be $val(\psi) \leq algval(\psi)$ which is similar to saying that if $algval(\psi) < 1$ then $A$ refutes $\psi$. The ideal goal would be to refute random $\psi$ with $m$ constraints with high probability\\

\noindent However, we take a look at semi-random XOR. Our refutation algorithm and the guarantee will still be the same:

\begin{equation*}
\psi \rightarrow A \rightarrow algval(\psi)
\end{equation*}

\noindent with the guarantee that $val(\psi) \leq algval(\psi)$.\\

\noindent So, now we generate semi-random $\psi w/ m$ constraints:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The worst case would be random $q$-unif hypergraph
    \item Random RHS $b_c$ for each $C \in H$
\end{itemize}

\noindent The equation we have is:

\begin{equation}
    \sum_{j \in C} x_j = b_c
\end{equation}

\noindent And we also already know that 

\begin{equation*}
    \psi_b \textit{ is } \sum_{j \in C}
\end{equation*}

\noindent And, $xj = b_i, i \in [k], C \in H_i$.

\noindent $\psi_b$ is almost semi-random.\\

\noindent Thus, we have shown \ref{proofp1}{ Part 1 of Proof}.

\subsection{Proof: Existing $q$-LDC lower bound for $q$ even}

$q$-LDC XOR instance $\psi_b$ is encoded by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $q$-uniform hypergraph matchings $\{ H_1 \cdots H_k \}$
    \item right-hand sides are random $b_i \in \{ \pm 1 \}$
    \item We have constraints $\displaystyle\prod_{j \in C} x_j=b_i$ for all $i$ and $C \in H_i$
\end{itemize}

\noindent We now have a goal to argue that $\psi_b$ unsat with high probability for random when $b$ when $n \ll k^{q/(q-2)}$\\

\noindent frac. constraints satisfied by $x \in \{ \pm 1 \}^n$ is $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{f(x)}{2}$.\\

\noindent Here $f(x)$ is:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:5}
f(x) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i} b_i \sum_{C \in H_i} \prod_{j \in C} x_j
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
m = k \cdot \delta n
\end{equation*}

\noindent This makes our goal to be to certify with high probability that:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:6}
\max_{x \in \{ \pm 1 \}^n} f(x) < 1 \textit{ when } n \ll k^{\frac{q}{q-2}}
\end{equation}

\noindent We will now try to refute $\psi_b$. With Equation \ref{eq:5} and Equation \ref{eq:6} to refute $\psi_b$ is like showing:

\begin{equation}
\textit{w.h.p. } \max_{x \in \{ \pm 1 \}^n} f(x) < 1 \textit{ where } f(x) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i} b_i \sum_{C \in H_i} \prod_{j \in C} x_j
\end{equation}

\noindent $\textit{ when } n \ll k^{\frac{q}{q-2}}$.\\

\noindent The idea is to design a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ so that:

\begin{equation*}
f(x) \leq ||A||_{\infty \to 1} = \max_{z,w \in \{ \pm 1 \}^N} z^TAw
\end{equation*}

\noindent As shown by \citet{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1904.03858} the matrix $A$ can be indexed by

\begin{equation*}
S \in {[n] \choose l}
\end{equation*}

\noindent Assign $x \mapsto y$ such that $y^TAy \propto f(x)$

\noindent and $y_s := \displaystyle\prod_{j \in S} x_j$ which is simply the tensor product.\\\

\noindent We need to now be able to answer how to set $A(S,T)$

\begin{equation}
y^TAy = \sum_{S,T} y_Sy_TA(S,T) = \sum_{S,T} A(S,T) \displaystyle\prod_{j \in S \oplus T} x_j
\end{equation}

\noindent Which shows that we are actually using symmetric difference here.\\

\noindent We say that if $S \oplus T = C \in h_i$ then $\displaystyle\prod_{j \in S \oplus T} x_j = b_i$

\noindent $\implies A(S,T) = b_i$ if $S \oplus T = C \in H_i$\\

\begin{equation}
y^TAy = \sum_{i=1}^k b_i \sum_{C \in h_i} \sum_{S \oplus t = C} \displaystyle\prod_{j \in C}x_j = Dmf(x)
\end{equation}

\noindent Here $D =$ number of $S,T$ where $S \oplus T = C$.\\

\noindent Simplifying an earlier statement we can also say from here that: $A_C(S,T) = 1$ if $S \oplus T = C$.\\

\noindent For which $A_i = \sum_{C \in h_i} A_C$ and $A = \sum_{i=1}^k b_i A_i$\\

\noindent Set $y_S := \displaystyle\prod_{j \in S} x_j$\\

\noindent $y^TAy = Dmf(x) \implies Dmf(x) \leq ||A||_{\infty \to 1}$\\

\noindent Note that the way we defined $D$ here it only depends on $|C| = q$, we can say:

\begin{equation*}
D = {q \choose \frac{q}{2}} {n-q \choose l - \frac{q}{2}}
\end{equation*}

\noindent Also we know $A_c \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ and $N = {n \choose l}$.\\

\noindent We have already proven that $||A||_{\infty \to 1} \geq Dm \max_{x}f(x) \geq Dm \geq D \delta nk$\\

\noindent It is also interesting to note that $||A||_{\infty \to 1} \leq N ||A||_2$ and we still need to be able to show that with high probability that $||A||_{\infty \to 1}$ is not too large.\\

\noindent Matrix Bernstein: with high probability over $b_i$, $||A||_2 \leq \triangle \sqrt{kl}$ where $\triangle$ is the maximum number of 1's in a row in any $A_i$.\\

\noindent Expected number of 1's per row is $\delta n \frac{D}{N} \sim n (\frac{l}{n})^{q/2}$.\\

\noindent We can optimistically suppose that $\triangle \sim n (\frac{l}{n})^{q/2}$ however this also needs $l \geq n^{1-2/q}$.\\

\noindent Then $D \cdot \delta n k \leq ||A||_{\infty \to  1} \leq N \triangle \sqrt{kl}$\\

\noindent $\implies k \leq l$ since $\triangle \sim \delta n \frac{D}{N}$\\

\noindent Now take $l=n^{1-2/q} \implies k^{q/(q-2)} \leq n$\\

\noindent So, $\triangle =\frac{2l}{q}$\\

\noindent Because $H_i$ are matchings, a random row will have only $\approx \frac{\delta n D}{N}$ 1's.\\

\noindent The idea now is to prune off all the bad rows or columns in A to get B such that:

\begin{equation*}
||A||_{\infty \to 1} \leq ||B||_{\infty \to 1} +o(N)
\end{equation*}

\noindent And, $\triangle_B \sim \delta n (\frac{l}{n})^{q/2}$\\

\noindent And now we can just use $B$ instead which will prove $q$-LDC lower bound for $q$ even.

\subsection{Proof: $k^3$ lower bound}

Recall, $q$-LDC XOR instance $\psi_b$ is encoded by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $q$-uniform hypergraph matchings $\{ H_1 \cdots H_k \}$
    \item right-hand sides are random $b_i \in \{ \pm 1 \}$
    \item We have constraints $\displaystyle\prod_{j \in C} x_j=b_i$ for all $i$ and $C \in H_i$
\end{itemize}

\noindent The goal is argue that $\psi_b$ is unsatisfiable with high probability for random $b$. And the idea is to design a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ so that:

\begin{equation*}
f(x) \leq ||A||_{\infty \to 1} = \max_{z, w \in \{ \pm 1 \}^N z^TAw}
\end{equation*}

\noindent The previous approach fails because the $A$ from before requires $q$ to be even.\\

\noindent One attempt is to represent rows as $|S|=l$ and columns as $|T|=l+1$. However this will only get us to $k \leq \sqrt{n}$.\\

\noindent We need to derive more constraints, using $C_i \oplus C_j$ get us to $nk$ constraints so each $n_j$ is in $\approx k$ constraints $\implies$ new $nk^2$ constraints. \\

\noindent The matrix $A$ is indexed by $S$, $A(S,T)=b_ib_j$. The calculation is now:

\begin{equation*}
nk^2D \leq ||A||_{\infty \to 1} \leq N \triangle \sqrt{kl}
\end{equation*}

\noindent An optimist approach is $\triangle \sim Nk\frac{D}{N} = nk(\frac{l}{n})^2$\\

\noindent $\implies l \geq \sqrt{\frac{n}{k}}$\\

\noindent $\implies k \leq n \implies k^3 \leq n$\\

\noindent The row pruning tricks would still work provided that any $\{u, v\}$ is in at most $polylog(n)$ constraints.

\subsection{Conclusion}

This proof for $q=3$ is not generalizable for all odd $q$ and neither is a reduction to $2$-LDC. This is particularly true because of the row pruning step.

\section{Algorithms for the ferromagnetic Potts model on expanders}

14th October 2022\\

\noindent The related paper: Algorithms for the ferromagnetic Potts model on expanders by \citet{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2204.01923}. Seminar by \href{https://www.adityapotukuchi.com/}{Aditya Potukuchi}.

\subsection{Abstract}

\noindent The ferromagnetic Potts model is a canonical example of a Markov random field from statistical physics that is of great probabilistic and algorithmic interest. This is a distribution over all $1$-colorings of the vertices of a graph where monochromatic edges are favored. The algorithmic problem of efficiently sampling approximately from this model is known to be \#BIS-hard, and has seen a lot of recent interest. I will outline some recently developed algorithms for approximately sampling from the ferromagnetic Potts model on d-regular weakly expanding graphs. This is achieved by a significantly sharper analysis of standard "polymer methods" using extremal graph theory and applications of Karger's algorithm to count cuts that may be of independent interest. I will give an introduction to all the topics that are relevant to the results.

\subsection{The Ferromagnetic Potts Model}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{media/sample-graph.png}
\caption{A sample graph}
\label{fig:sample-graph}
\end{figure}

\noindent We start by defining some basic notation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $G$: finite graph on vertices $V$
    \item $q \in \mathbb{N}$, we are interested in $q$-colourings of the vertices in $G$
    \item $m(\chi)$: number of monochromatic edges induced by a colouring $\chi$
    \item Distribution on colourings given by $p(\chi) \propto exp(\beta \cdot m(\chi))$
    \item $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$: parameter, inverse temperature
\end{itemize}

\noindent Notice that for $\beta < 0$ it means that we take the antiferromagnetic case. Here we talk more about when $\beta > 0$ meaning it is ferromagnetic.\\

\noindent This could have quite some applications:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Modelling: Social networks, physics, chemistry, etc
    \item Markov Random field: Probabilistic Inference
    \item Connection to UGC \citet{coulson_et_al:LIPIcs:2020:12565}
    \item and more.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Problem}

\noindent we know $p(\chi) \propto exp(\beta \cdot m(\chi))$\\

\noindent Now for $\beta = 0$ it means that we are doing a uniform $q$-coloring of $V$\\

\noindent For $\beta = -\infty$ we do a uniform proper coloring of $G$\\

\noindent What we need to do is given $G$ and $\beta$, efficiently sample a coloring from this distribution.

\begin{equation}
    p(\chi) = \frac{exp(\beta m(\chi))}{\sum_{\chi}exp(\beta m(\chi))}
\end{equation}

\noindent We add the normalizing factor here:

\begin{equation*}
    \textit{Nomalizing factor } = \sum_{\chi}exp(\beta m(\chi))
\end{equation*}

\noindent Now we can also say,

\begin{equation}
    \sum_{\chi}exp(\beta m(\chi)) =: Z_G(q,\beta)
\end{equation}

\noindent A partition function of the model/distribution is very important for this POV.\\

\noindent Our problem is that given $G$ and $\beta$ we want to efficiently sample a color distribution. We give 2 facts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item It is enough to compute $Z_G(q,\beta)$
    \item \#P-hard
\end{enumerate}

\noindent We now modify the problem as: Given $G$ and $\beta$, efficiently sample \textbf{approximately} a colouring from this distribution.\\

\noindent $\epsilon$ approximation will have us sample a law from $q$ such that $||p-q||_{TVD} \leq \epsilon$, thus

\begin{equation}
    ||p-q||_{TVD} := \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\chi} |p(\chi) - q(\chi)|
\end{equation}

\noindent We modify our original problem template to now be: Given $G$ and $\beta$, efficiently sample $\epsilon$-\textbf{approximately} a colouring from this distribution.\\

\noindent Fully Polynomial Almost Uniform Sampler can allow us to sample $\epsilon$-approximately in $poly(G,\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ time.\\

\noindent Instead Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme: $1 \pm \epsilon$-factor approximation in $poly(G,\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ time.\\

\noindent We can also show for a fact that $FPTAS \iff FPAUS$.

\subsection{Antiferromagnetic Potts model}

\noindent The Antiferromagnetic Potts model:

\begin{equation}    
p(\chi) \propto exp{\beta \cdot m(\chi)}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\beta < 0$\\

\noindent Given $G$ and $\beta < 0$, we want to be able to give an FPAUS for this distribution. It is then equivalent to instead work on the problem: given $G$ and $\beta < 0$, give an FPTAS for its partition function $Z_G(q, \beta)$.\\

\noindent From some previous work, we know that there exists a $\beta_c$ such that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item for $\beta < \beta_c$, FPTAS exists 
    \item For $\beta < \beta_c$, no FPTAS unless $NP = RP$
\end{itemize}

\noindent We can say that this is \#BIS-hard (bipartite independent sets). Thus, doing this is at least as hard as an FPTAS for the number of independent sets in bipartite graphs. If our graph has no bipartiteness then this becomes a NP-hard problem.\\

\noindent For now, let's consider the problem given a bipartite graph $G$, design an FPTAS for the number of individual sets in $G$. This accurately captures the difficulty of: the number of proper $q$-colorings of a bipartite graph for $q \geq 3$, the number of stable matchings, the number of antichains in posets.

\subsection{Main Results}

\noindent For our purposes we assume that $G$ is always a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices. Now for a set $S \subset V$, we define it's edge boundary as:

\begin{equation*}
    \triangledown(S) := \# (uv \in G | u \in S, v \notin S)
\end{equation*}

\noindent Now, $G$ is an $\eta$ expander if for every $S \subset V$ of size at most $n/2$, we have $|\triangledown(S)| \geq \eta|S|$. For example we can take a discrete cube $Q_d$ with vertices $\{0,1\}^d$, $uv$ is an edge if $u$ and $v$ differ in exactly 1 coordinate.

\noindent Using a simplification of the Harper's Theorem we can say that $Q_d$ is a $1$-expander \cite{frankl1981short}.\\

\begin{theorem}
For each $\epsilon > 0$ and there is a $d=d(\epsilon)$ and $q = q(\epsilon)$ such that there is an FPTAS for $Z_G(q, \beta)$ where $G$ is a $d$-regular $2$-expander providing the following conditions hold:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $q=poly(d)$
    \item $\beta \notin (2 \pm \epsilon)\frac{ln(q)}{d}$
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\noindent The main result shown was that 

\begin{theorem}
For each $\epsilon > 0$, and $d$ large enough, there is an FPTAS for $Z_G(q, \beta)$ where $G$ for the class of $d$-regular triangle-free $1$-expander grpahs providing the following conditions hold:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $q \geq poly(d)$
    \item $\beta \notin (2 \pm \epsilon)\frac{ln(q)}{d}$
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\noindent This was previously known for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Stronger expansion and $d = q^{\Omega(d)}$
    \item Higher temperature and $q = d^{\Omega(d)}$
\end{itemize}

\noindent Something to note here is that $q \geq poly(d)$ should not be a necessary condition.\\

\noindent As well as as in the case $\beta \leq (1-\epsilon) \beta_0$ does not require expansion or even that $q \geq poly(d)$.

\subsection{Potts Distribution}

\noindent We first write the order-disorder threshold of the ferromagnetic Potts model

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    \beta_0 :=& ln(\frac{q-2}{(q-1)^{1-2/d} - 1})\\
    \beta_0 =& 2 \frac{ln q}{d} (1+O(\frac{1}{q}))
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent We want to be able to know more about how the Potts distribution looks for $\beta < (1-\epsilon)\beta_0$ and for $\beta > (1+\epsilon)\beta_0$

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{media/potts-model.jpg}
\caption{Rough picture of the Potts model}
\label{fig:potts-model}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Results}

Another result we have is:

\begin{theorem}
    For each $\epsilon>0$, let $d$ be large enough $q \geq poly(d)$, and $G$ be a $d$-regular $2$-expander graph on $n$ vertices then,

    \begin{itemize}
        \item For $\beta < (1-\epsilon) \beta_0$, every colour class has size $n/q (1 \pm o(1))$ with high probability
        \item For $\beta > (1+\epsilon) \beta_0$, every colour class has size $n-o(n)$ with high probability
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\noindent The strategy we have, to prove the theorem for $\beta < (1-\epsilon) \beta_0$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pass to the Random Cluster Model
    \item Distribution on subsets of edges: $p(A) \propto q^{k(A)} (e^{\beta}-1)^{|A|}$
    \item $Z_G^{RC}(q, \beta) = Z_G^{Potts}(q, \beta)$
    \item Sampling algorithm: Sample from random cluster model, give each connected component a uniform color
    \item Standard polymer methods + careful enumeration
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Polymer Methods}

\noindent The motivating idea is to visualize the state for $\beta$ large at low temperature as ground state + defects.\\

\noindent Typical Colouring = Ground State + Defects\\

\noindent Polymer methods are pretty useful in such cases. These were first proposed in \cite{10.1145/3313276.3316305} and originated in statistical physics. We take $G$ to be our defect graph and each node in this represents a defect.\\

\noindent Now using Polymer methods $X \sim _GY$

\noindent Ideas is to $Z_G(q,\beta) \sim Z_{red} + Z_{blue}+\dots$ where $Z_{red} \approx e^{\beta nd/2}$\\

\noindent $Z_{red} e^{-\beta nd/2} = \sum_{I \subset V(G)} \prod_{\gamma \in I}w_{\gamma}$ where $w_{\gamma}$ is the weight of polymer $\gamma$.\\

We now move towards cluster expansion: multivariate in the $w_{\gamma}$ Taylor expansion of:

\begin{equation*}
    ln(\sum_{I \subset V(G)} \prod_{\gamma \in I}w_{\gamma})
\end{equation*}

\noindent This is an infinite sum, so convergence is not guaranteed however convergence can be established by verifying the Kotecký-Preiss criterion.\\

\noindent We also want to answer how many connected subsets are there of a given edge boundary in an $\eta$-expander?

\noindent A heuristic we have is to count the number of such subsets that contain a given vertex $u$: a typical connected subgraph of size $a$ is tree-like, i.e., has edge boundary $a \cdot d$.\\

\noindent Working backward, a typically connected subgraph with edge boundary size $b$ has $O(b/d)$ vertices. The number of such subgraphs $\leq$ number of connected subgraphs of size $O(b/d)$ containing $u$. The original number of subsets is also $\leq$ Number of rooted (at $u$) trees with $O(b/d)$ vertices and maximum degree at most $d = d^{O(b/d)}$. Thus,

\begin{theorem}
    At most $d^{O(1+1/\eta)b/d}$ connected subsets in an $\eta$ expander that contains $u$ have edge boundary of size at most $b$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent Another question to ask is how many $q$-colorings of an $\eta$-expander induce at most $k$ non-monochromatic edges?\\

\noindent  Easiest way is to make $k$ non-monochrimatic edges is to color all but $k/d$ randomly chosen vertices with the same color. Now, $k$ small $\implies$ these vertices likely form an independent set. we now color these $k/d$ vertices arbitrarily. There are:

\begin{equation*}
    {n \choose k/d} q^{k/d+1}
\end{equation*}

\noindent ways.

\begin{theorem}
    For $\eta$-expanders and $q \geq poly(d)$ there are at most $n^4 q^{O(k/d)}$ possible colourings.
\end{theorem}

\noindent Now we also know the maximum value of $Z_G(q,\beta)$ over all graphs $G$ with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and max degree $d$. This will always be attained when $G$ is a disjoint union of $K_{d+1}$ and $K_1$
